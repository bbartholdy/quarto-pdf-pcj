  This is a background of the research in our field which we use to contextualise the need for our study. 
  Then we talk about what we did and how we did it. Some results are mentioned, some figures and tables,
  statistical tests, which we of course report with more than just a p-value.
  Finally we make some totally reasonable interpretations based on our results and put them into a broader
  context.

# Introduction

This is an example of text. This realization is especially important because it can flip around our expectations about which species expand fast, and how to manage them. We tend to think of initial colonization and long-term abundance as two independent axes of variation among species or indeed as two ends of a spectrum, in the classic competition-colonization tradeoff [@levins1971regional]. When both play into invasion speed, good dispersers might not outrun good competitors. This is useful knowledge, whether we want to contain an invasion or secure a reintroduction.

## A subsection

In their study "When higher carrying capacities lead to faster propagation",
@levins1971regional combine mathematical analysis, Individual-Based simulations and experiments to show that various mechanisms can cause pushed fronts, whose speed increases with the carrying capacity K of the species. Rather than focus on one particular angle, the authors endeavor to demonstrate that this qualitative effect appears again and again in a variety of settings.

### A Subsubsection

It is perhaps surprising that this notable and general connection between K and invasion speed has managed to garner so little fame in ecology. A large fraction of the literature employs the venerable Fisher-KPP reaction-diffusion model, which combines local logistic growth with linear diffusion in space. This model has prompted both considerable mathematical developments [@crooks2004spatial] and many applications to modelling real invasions [@shigesada1997biological]. But it only allows pulled fronts, driven by the small populations at the edge of a species range, with a speed that depends only on their initial growth rate r.  
A subparagraph (the preceding line is ended with two spaces, i.e., *...growth rate r.*\\s\\s).

A new paragraph with very little content.

# Materials and Methods

We did some things with some stuff.


# Results

Our results came out completely as we expected, as you can see in the table.

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |

@fig-plot is TOTALLY relevant to the study.

![This figure shows one of the Datasaurus Dozen datasets. These are multiple different datasets that all produce essentially the same descriptive statistics, showing the importance of data visaulisation. The original Datasaurus was created by Alberto Cairo.](datasaurus.png){#fig-plot}

We also performed additional analyses, but these are beyond the scope of this initial exploratory template study.
@eq-linear is a random equation.

# Discussion

We interpret this as being cool. To conclude: Science! End of study.
