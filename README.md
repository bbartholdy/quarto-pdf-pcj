# Peer Community Journal Submission Formatting

This is a Quarto extension that can be used to format a manuscript for submission to the Peer Community Journal.
I am in the process of submitting a paper myself, but for now I **cannot** confirm whether the extension
sufficiently adheres to the format requirements.

To format a preprint for submission to one of the thematic PCIs, I highly recommend the
[Quarto typst extension](https://github.com/alxsimon/typst-pci) created by [Alexis Simon](https://github.com/alxsimon).
